        For beef, slice beef into thin slices and tenderize with a fork. Trim away any fat and gristle. Marinate, slice, and thread onto skewers as for chicken.
        Make extra marinade, reduce in a saucepan over high heat for about 5 minutes, and strain to make a dipping sauce for the satay.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <u1>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <l1>meat of your choice</l1>
        <li>1 garlic</li>
        <li>1 ginger</li>
        <li>1 cumin</li>
        <li>1 brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tumeric</li>
        <li>10 bamboo skewers</li>
      <u1>

      <h2> Steps </h2>

      <ol type="1">
        <li> In a large nonreactive bowl, stir together the onion, garlic, lemon grass, soy sauce, peanut oil, turmeric, brown sugar, cumin, ginger, salt, and pepper. Reserve about 2 tablespoons of marinade in a small bowl, and refrigerate until cooking time. Mix the chicken breasts into the remaining marinade, stir to coat well, and marinate in refrigerator overnight.
        </li>
        <li> About 30 minutes before serving, soak the skewers in water. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the chicken breasts from the bowl, and discard the used marinade. Cut each chicken breast on the diagonal into 6 long strips, and thread a chicken strip onto one of the soaked skewers. Grill the skewers, turning frequently and basting with the reserved marinade, until the chicken is cooked through with brown, crispy edges, 5 to 8 minutes per skewer.
        </li>
